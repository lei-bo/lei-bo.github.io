I am a Machine Learning Postdoctoral Researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. 
 
My research centers on deep learning, graph neural networks, generative AI, and their applications in 
scientific and engineering problems. Current projects include generative models for materials science and graph-based
surrogate models for accelerating scientific simulations.

**About Me**: I earned my PhD in Materials Science and Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by 
[Prof. Elizabeth A. Holm](https://mse.engin.umich.edu/people/eaholm). My research focused on using machine learning and
computer vision to analyze materials microstructures. I also completed a Master of Science in Machine Learning at CMU.
My undergraduate studies were in Materials Chemistry at Peking University.
